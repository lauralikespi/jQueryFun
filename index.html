<!-- It is your job to make this a website - with proper layout, and nice styling. Follow the commands to add some responsiveness using jQuery -->
<h1> My website for playing with jQuery </h1>
<h2> Make me green when you click on me </h2>
<!-- Can you arrange the following pictures in a carousel?? -->
<h3> My Pretty Carousel </h3>
<img src="puppy1.jpg">
<img src="puppy2.jpeg">
<img src="puppy3.jpg">
<!--- Note you can do this using bootstrap or using another jQuery library (I like bxslider) -->
<!-- If you're a pro, add the other pictures as well -->
<h2> I'm a h2 as well, but I don't want to be green on clicking.... Make me disappear on hovering.</h2>
<p> When your mouse touches me, I should get bigger </p>
<!-- Can you do it so I get bigger each time the mouse touches the words?? -->
<p> Now you're getting this, add a multiple event handler to this paragraph (i.e. when you click something happens, when you hit enter something happens, when you hover - whatever you want). </p>
<p> When you click the button below, make the next paragraph animated!! </p>
<button type="button"> Click me! Click me! </button>
<br>
<div> I want to be animated!!! </div>
<!-- Note you might need to add some CSS to the div to be able to see any animations. If you're stuck for ideas, add a background colour and increase the height and width -->
